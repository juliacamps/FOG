Freezing of Gait detection using deep learning techniques combined with signal processing strategies

This project is to present a new approach for freezing fo gait (FoG) events in Parkinson's diseas (PD) patients, by means of using combined strategies of deep-learning and signal processing. The data being used is data from real PD patients, and is composed by three tri-axial sensors (i.e. giroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer). The goal of this project is to outperform the [current state of the art methods](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11517-015-1395-3), which achive arround 85 % using shallow machine learning algorithms (i.e. SVM).
